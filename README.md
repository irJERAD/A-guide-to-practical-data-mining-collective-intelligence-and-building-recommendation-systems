I did not create this material, that distinction belongs to [Ron Zachariski](http://zacharski.org).
I simply found that in working through [A guide to practical data mining, collective intelligence, and building recommendation systems](http://guidetodatamining.com) by [Ron Zachariski](http://zacharski.org), that a Github repo for myself and any others interested in working through the chapters and exercises would benefit from.

Each Chapter directory should contain the PDF with the relavent lesson and reading as well as the python scripts associated with each chapter and a **README** document citing sources for the data.

In some cases where the data is small enough or reduced for the lessons' sake, the reduced dataset will be included in the directory. a Reference to the location of the datasets origin can always be found in the chapter's **README** document.
